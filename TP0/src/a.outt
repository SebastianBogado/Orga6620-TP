∫8f>            a branch is thus really a label that is always on the commit that most SCMs would call the branch/HEAD version.
            branches from other repositories are maintained in .git/refs/remotes
ÂŒ            collectively, all the commits form a tree-like structure based on the parent relationship, whence the concept of branches derives.
            creating a commit does not affect the working tree.
P            git will complain if a shortened identifier is ambiguous.
ra!            local branches live in .git/refs/heads
            the new commit becomes the current commit and incorporates the staged changes, so they no longer show up as differences between the commit and the working tree.
            unstaged changes thus continue to show as differences, until added to the index (or reverted).
        .git/refs/heads/master contains a 40 character identifier for the commit that is the master branch. Much Git metadata is in plain text files.
        a branch is a special mobile tag that is updated whenever a commit is made to that branch.
        a tag marks a particular commit and is only ever moved manually; other SCMs might call it a label.
        creating a commit (with "git commit") copies the staged changes into a new commit and then clears the index
        each commit has a reference to its parent commit(s).
        each commit is uniquely identified to Git commands by a 40-character identifier, but it's usually sufficiently unique to provide only the first seven characters of it.
        each commit represents a snapshot of the full tree of files current at the point the commit was created.
 rememb¡        file changes explicitly added to the index are termed "staged changes".
`ÂŒ        file changes made but not (or not yet) added to the index are termed "unstaged changes".
ctivelyq        staged and unstaged changes coexist harmlessly (and can be seen with "git status").
 brap        the index can even be told to stage selected "hunks" (patches/blocks of change) within a file, while leaving other hunks within the very same file unstaged.

A Git repository ‚Äî data and metadata ‚Äî is completely contained within its directory, so a normal system-level copy (or rename, or delete) of an entire Git repository is a safe operation. The resulting copy is both independent of and unaware of the original.
Adoption
∑8f>After the first "git clone" or "git init" operation, git sets the "current branch" to be "master" and will make sure that the working tree reflects the commit to which the "master" branch points. Each commit will have its parent set to the commit currently marked "master", and "master" will be moved to that new commit, ready for the next one.

Data
During a normal work session, one can choose to ask Git to note for later some or all of the differences between how the files are now and how Git's permanent repository remembers them. The place it remembers them is called "the staging area" (or index) and remembering them is called "staging". One can also remove or exclude selected changes from staging if it suits. Staging diffs is easy, and is similar in concept to creating a patch file. Staging is the precursor to committing those changes as a permanent record in the Git repository.
Git is primarily developed on GNU/Linux, although it also supports most major operating systems including BSD, Solaris, OS X, and Microsoft Windows.[41]
‰ŒGit servers typically listen on TCP port 9418.[40]
. ThiAGit stores each revision of a file as a unique blob object. The relationships between the blobs can be found through examining the tree and commit objects. Newly added objects are stored in their entirety using zlib compression. This can consume a large amount of disk space quickly, so objects can be combined into packs, which use delta compression to save space, storing blobs as their changes relative to other blobs.

Terminology and structure
ŒThe "behind the scenes" source control elements live within the .git/ directory at the root of the repository.
The Dulwich implementation of Git is a pure Python software component for Python 2.[43]
!The Eclipse Foundation reported in its annual community survey that as of May 2012 Git is the primary source control system used by over 27% of professional software developers, an increase from 12.8% in 2011.[47] Open source directory Ohloh reports a similar uptake among open source projects.[48]
The JGit implementation of Git is a pure Java software library, designed to be embedded in any Java application.[42]
ed ÅThe UK IT jobs website itjobswatch.co.uk reports that as of July 2012, approximately 7% of UK permanent software development job openings list Git as a requirement,[49] compared to 19.9% for Subversion,[50] 9.1% for Microsoft Team Foundation Server,[51] and 2.6% for Visual SourceSafe.[52]
The files and directories ‚Äî the things typically considered to be "under source control, but checked out" that the user changes in an editor or otherwise ‚Äî live under the top repository directory, but outside of its .git/ directory.
The following Web sites provide free source code hosting for Git repositories:[53]
to be1The libgit2 implementation of Git is an ANSI C software library, which can be built on multiple platforms including Microsoft Windows, Linux, Mac OS X, and BSD.[44] It is used as the basis for Git libraries for the Ruby and Python programming languages.[45][46]
bg!The working environment looks much like it would as if Git wasn't around: the working tree is a normal directory with only the subtle presence of a .git directory to suggest otherwise.
